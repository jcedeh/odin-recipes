    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
        <li>2 (16.3 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Colby Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons everything bagel seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Line 16 wells of standard muffin tins with cupcake liners.
        </li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; 
            crumble when cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully stretch each biscuit into a circle about 4 inches in diameter. 
            Fill each one with 1 tablespoon bacon, 2  tablespoons cheese and 1 to 2 teaspoons 
            green onions. Wrap edges of dough around fillings and pinch together to seal, 
            forming a ball. Place each biscuit seam side down into prepared muffin tins.
        </li>
        <li>Brush the top of each biscuit with egg and sprinkle evenly with bagel seasoning.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 17 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
